;; dynamic var binding — binding / with-bindings* / var-set / thread-bound? /
;; with-local-vars / with-redefs / bound-fn* / get-thread-bindings.
;;
;; A per-thread dynamic-binding stack: a list of frames, innermost (most recently
;; pushed) at the HEAD. Each frame is (owner . alist): the alist holds
;; (var-cell . value) MUTABLE pairs — so var-set can update the innermost binding
;; in place (set-cdr!), matching Clojure where var-set targets the current
;; binding, not the root — and `owner` is who pushed it (dyn-owner below), the
;; JVM's Var$TBox.thread. A frame is SHARED across threads by conveyance (a
;; future, an agent action, a go block restore the parent's stack, frames and
;; pairs and all, as Frame.clone shares the TBoxes), so the owner is what lets
;; Var.set refuse a write from any thread but the one that bound the var.
;;
;; The binding macro builds a frame as a jolt map (array-map of (var x) -> value);
;; push-thread-bindings folds it into the alist. Lookups walk frames by cell
;; IDENTITY (eq?) — vars are interned, so (var x) always yields the same cell, and
;; this sidesteps a persistent-hash-map-can't-find-a-var-key quirk.
;;
;; var reads (var-deref in compiled code, jolt-var-get / deref on a cell) consult
;; the stack before falling back to the cell root. Loaded LAST (after vars.ss and
;; ns.ss) so it chains the fully-extended jolt-var-get and overrides rt.ss var-deref.

;; THREAD-LOCAL: a Chez thread parameter, so each OS thread (a future / go block)
;; has its own binding stack. Chez initializes a new thread's parameter
;; to the spawning thread's value at fork time, giving Clojure binding conveyance
;; for free (the future shim also installs an explicit snapshot, belt-and-suspenders).

;; --- pushing a frame ---------------------------------------------------------
;; THE one place a frame reaches the stack. Everything else — the loader's
;; per-file vars, cpath-with-compile-files, the agent's *agent*, and
;; push-thread-bindings itself — goes through here, so the dyn-bound? flags below
;; cannot be set in some paths and forgotten in others. (Restoring a whole stack
;; captured elsewhere, which is what the future/agent/executor conveyance does, is
;; not a push: those frames were built by a push that already flagged them.)
;; A hand-rolled loop rather than for-each: this is on every push, and the closure
;; for-each wants cost a one-var frame ~7 ns of its 140.
;; The owner of a frame pushed now: the fiber running here, else the OS thread.
;; A fiber is the unit that binds — its slice carries its own stack, and a fiber
;; spawned inside a binding conveys the parent's frames exactly as a thread
;; does — so on a carrier the thread id alone would let one fiber write another's
;; binding. Gambit has no fibers; its shim answers #f.

;;                   thunk
;;                   (lambda () (dyn-binding-stack (cdr (dyn-binding-stack)))))
;;
;; jolt-fiber-to-scheduler! saves the fiber's slice — which already contains the
;; pushed frame — BEFORE the escape unwinds. The unwind pops it. On resume the
;; slice is restored, putting the frame back, and THEN the continuation rewinds
;; and that before-thunk pushes a SECOND one. Measured on an ordinary explicit
;; park, no preemption involved: depth went 1 before the park and 2 after,
;; leaking a frame past the end of the extent.
;;
;; The general rule, which is what the shape below encodes: a winder must not
;; re-establish state the jolt-dslice already carries. The dslice owns
;; dyn-binding-stack, so the push happens ONCE, OUTSIDE the dynamic-wind, and
;; the before-thunk does nothing. A park then costs nothing to get right — the
;; slice was saved before the after-thunk ran, and restoring it on resume is the
;; whole recovery.
;;
;; The after-thunk restores the stack it found rather than popping one frame.
;; Absolute, not relative, for the same reason parameterize is written that way:
;; a relative edit is only correct if the stack is exactly as deep as it was, and
;; an escape is precisely when it is not.
;;
;; Masked at both edges (jolt-wind*, host/chez/locks.ss): an interrupt's escape
;; between the push and the wind left the frame on the stack, and one between the
;; thunk's return and the after-thunk left it there too.

;; --- reading a var -----------------------------------------------------------
;; THE GATE, and why every read below opens with it.
;;
;; dyn-bound? is Clojure's Var.threadBound. Without it every var reference in
;; compiled code — every clojure.core/map?, every user fn — crossed the whole
;; binding stack to discover there was nothing to find, because the stack is
;; non-empty for the duration of any compile or load and `assq` cannot answer
;; "absent" early. Measured, counting frames crossed:
;;
;;   emitting 120 nested fn literals   2.04M frames, 92.5% of them by lookups that
;;                                     found nothing, 16 vars ever bound in the
;;                                     whole process
;;   compiling clojure/set.clj         194k frames, 99.4% by lookups that found
;;                                     nothing, 20 vars ever bound
;;
;; So the walk was almost entirely spent proving a negative about vars nobody
;; binds, and the flag answers exactly that in one field read: 6 ns flat against
;; 1425 ns at depth 512 (bench/dyn-binding, `make dynbench`).
;;
;; WHAT MAKES IT SOUND is one invariant: if a cell appears in any frame of THIS
;; THREAD's stack, its flag is set. Every way a stack comes to be preserves it —
;; a push flags the frame's cells before publishing it (dyn-push-frame!, the only
;; one), a pop only removes, and the future / agent / executor / fiber-slice paths
;; install a stack some earlier push already built. The flag is never cleared, so
;; nothing can un-flag a cell that is still bound somewhere.
;;
;; That is also why it needs no synchronisation. A binding is visible only to the
;; thread that pushed it and to threads that inherited that stack at fork, and in
;; both cases the flag write happened before the stack the reader can see. Cells
;; flagged by an unrelated thread only cost this one a fruitless walk, which is
;; the direction that is safe. A field write is a whole-value write — the same
;; argument meta and macro? rest on.
;;
;; MONOTONE and process-wide, like the JVM's: a var bound once pays the walk
;; forever after. That costs the ~16 vars that are genuinely dynamic nothing they
;; were not already paying.
;;
;; What it does NOT do is make a var that IS bound cheap to find: that is still a
;; walk, and still O(depth). It is 7.5% of the frames above and was not worth a
;; second mechanism — jolt-3bo records the cumulative index that would kill it and
;; the measurement that said not to bother yet.

;; The walk itself, ungated, so the two readers below test the flag exactly once.
