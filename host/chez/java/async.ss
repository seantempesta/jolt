;; async.ss — clojure.core.async channel primitives on real OS threads.
;;
;; A `go` block is an OS thread and a channel is a Chez mutex+condition blocking
;; queue: <! / >! are the blocking <!! / >!! (they "park" by blocking the thread),
;; and work ANYWHERE — no CPS transform, no go-only restriction. Real parallelism,
;; shared heap. This is a superset of the JVM model: it has no fixed go-block
;; thread pool, no MAX-QUEUE-SIZE on pending ops, and parking ops are legal outside
;; a go block. One OS thread per go block (fine for typical use).
;;
;; Channel: an unbuffered channel is a rendezvous (the putter blocks until its
;; value is taken); a buffered (chan n) put blocks only when full; dropping/sliding
;; buffers never block the putter. A transducer is applied on the put side; an
;; optional ex-handler catches a throw from the transducer step.
;;
;; This file provides the primitives; the higher-level dataflow API (mult, mix,
;; pub/sub, pipeline, map, merge, reduce, …) is a Clojure overlay over them.
;; `thread` is a macro here (mark-macro!) expanding to thread-spawn. `go` and
;; `go-loop` are NOT: they live in the overlay, because the CPS pass that decides
;; a park's representation per site needs &env, macroexpand and resolve, which a
;; Scheme expander over reader forms does not have. go-spawn — the runtime the
;; overlay's fallback path emits — stays here. Loaded after concurrency.ss
;; (reuses ms->duration). Requires a threaded Chez build.

;; --- alt-handler: the ONE waiter notion (alts!, plus R3 fiber waiters) --------
;; A pending channel operation is a handler with active?/claim/commit semantics
;; and a wakeup strategy. The `wake` field is #f for a thread-waiter (the
;; blocked <!!/>!! waiter: alt-deliver! signals wcv, exactly as before) or a
;; fiber record for a fiber-waiter (alt-deliver! resumes it — enqueues it on
;; its carrier's run queue). The channel core never inspects the wake: it
;; commits via claim+mailbox and lets the handler decide how to wake. This is
;; the R3 waiter protocol — one handler notion, two wakeup strategies, no fork
;; of the channel code into fiber and thread paths. The name stays alt-handler
;; because the alt-takers/alt-putters lists ARE the shared waiter lists: a
;; fiber's <! registers as an alt-taker, exactly as alts! does.

;; --- channels ---------------------------------------------------------------
;; items: an amortized-O(1) FIFO held as a mutable #(out in len) — `out` is the
;; front (pop from its head), `in` holds pushed entries reversed onto it, `len` is
;; the count (an append-to-a-list FIFO is O(n) per push and O(n) to measure).
;; Each entry is (value . box); box is #f for a buffered value or a 1-slot vector
;; for an unbuffered rendezvous put (set #t when taken, waking the putter).
;; cap 0 + kind 'unbuffered = rendezvous; cap>0 with kind fixed/dropping/sliding.
;; takew counts threads parked in a blocking take (so a non-blocking offer! to an
;; unbuffered channel can tell a taker is waiting). alt-takers/alt-putters are
;; pending alt-handler registrations (alts! ops parked on this channel). xrf is the
;; transducer reducing fn (or #f); exh the ex-handler (or #f). cvw counts every
;; thread waiting on cv, takers and putters alike (ac-cv-wait), so a take or put
;; that nobody waits on skips the broadcast (ac-broadcast!). That is not a nicety
;; on Android: bionic's pthread_cond_broadcast makes a futex syscall whether or
;; not anyone waits (glibc's and macOS's return first), 187ns against 6ns here,
;; and every take and put broadcast, so an immediate take cost 350ns there.
;; Every broadcast and every wait runs holding mu, so the count cannot miss a
;; waiter: one that has not counted itself yet re-checks its condition under mu
;; before it waits.
;;
;; The layout is image surface (a channel travels raw, its mu and cv swapped for
;; image-sync placeholders): async-chan-v3, without cvw, restores through
;; state-image.ss's legacy arm. The v3 uid is retired.

;; --- the blocking ops are interruptible, the parking ones are not ------------
;; <!!, >!! and alts!! block a thread on the JVM by deref'ing a promise, so
;; .interrupt throws InterruptedException out of them and clears the flag, and a
;; flag already set makes them throw as soon as they would wait. <!, >! and alts!
;; park a go block, which on the JVM holds no thread to interrupt. So INTR? below
;; is #t only for the three blocking vars; the parking ones, go bodies on the
;; thread backend, the fallback threads put!/take! fork, and every other piece of
;; channel plumbing pass #f and wait exactly as before (locks.ss: interrupting
;; runtime plumbing breaks the runtime, not the caller's code).
;;
;; THE FLAG IS READ ONLY WHEN THE OP WOULD WAIT, at entry and after every wake.
;; An op that can complete completes, and leaves a set flag set. That is the JVM's
;; rule for the entry (the op returns straight from take!/put! without touching
;; the promise), and applied after a wake it keeps every outcome linearizable:
;; either the op finished before the interrupt (value returned, flag still set)
;; or the interrupt came first (nothing consumed, flag cleared, throw). The JVM
;; deref can do neither: its handler stays registered after the throw, so a later
;; put hands a value to a taker that is gone, and a later taker takes the value of
;; a put that threw. jolt retracts instead (known-divergences.edn).
;;
;; (ac-intr-wait! mu cv wait reg) — with MU held and the op committed to waiting.
;; REG is what the previous round answered: #f before the first wait, else the
;; op's registration. Answers #f when the calling thread is interrupted (flag
;; consumed, registration dropped, nothing waited), else runs WAIT (which waits on
;; cv, releasing mu) and answers the registration to pass to the next round.
;;
;; The registration is locks.ss's jolt-cv-wait-interruptibly protocol: the waiter
;; lists (mu . cv) where its interrupt box's wake will find it and re-reads the
;; flag after, because the interrupter sets the flag BEFORE the wake reads the
;; entry and takes mu to wake — so it either found the entry and its broadcast
;; waits on the mu held here, or it did not and the re-read sees its flag. It is
;; made ONCE PER OP and kept across wakes, and the op drops it (ac-unreg!) on every
;; way out; the listing itself is the thread's standing cell below. Made per round, it put
;; two operations on the registry's one global mutex into every wake, and a put to
;; a channel with 1000 threads blocked in <!! wakes all 1000 (the condition is a
;; broadcast): 2000 contended acquisitions per put, which cost a 1000-taker fan-out
;; about 35%. Kept across rounds, a wake reads the flag and nothing else, since the
;; mu held from that read to the next wait closes the same window the re-read does.
;; Threads only: a fiber never reaches these waits (the fiber ops divert first,
;; fibers-async.ss).

;; Drop an op's registration, if it made one (REG from ac-intr-wait!, or #f/#t).
;; A plain write: a wake that still reads the old entry broadcasts on a condition
;; nobody it concerns is waiting on, which every waiter already survives.

;; --- the shared timer -------------------------------------------------------
;; ONE timer thread serves every deadline in the runtime — no per-call OS thread.
;; Pending entries are kept as a sorted list of (deadline-ms . thunk) by ascending
;; deadline. The timer runs every thunk whose deadline has passed, then waits for
;; the nearest remaining one; an insert that becomes the HEAD signals timeout-cv,
;; because that is exactly when the deadline it is waiting for changed.
;;
;; A THUNK AND NOT A CHANNEL. (timeout ms) is one caller and closes a channel;
;; the other is a fiber in a timed wait on a condition variable, which needs
;; waking at the deadline (jolt-cv-wait, host/chez/locks.ss). Nothing about a
;; deadline is specific to channels, and a second timer thread for the second
;; kind of deadline would be a second thing to get wrong — this one already had
;; two bugs of its own (jolt-pe84).
;;
;; THE THUNKS RUN OUTSIDE timeout-mu. They used to run under it, which was
;; survivable while the only thunk was a channel close, and is not survivable in
;; general: a thunk that takes a lock while the timer holds timeout-mu puts
;; timeout-mu above that lock in the order, and any code that registers a deadline
;; while holding it closes a cycle. Collecting the due entries under the lock and
;; running them after it is released means the timer holds nothing while calling
;; out, so registering a deadline from inside any critical section stays safe.
;;
;; THE WAIT IS A TIMED condition-wait HELD UNDER timeout-mu, AND THE THREAD IS
;; FORKED ONCE. Both were otherwise, and each was a bug (jolt-pe84):
;;
;;   * The timer used to release timeout-mu and `sleep` to the nearest deadline,
;;     so it was not on timeout-cv when a nearer deadline arrived. The signal
;;     went nowhere and the new timeout did not fire until the deadline the timer
;;     was already sleeping to: a (timeout 100) created while a (timeout 3000)
;;     was pending took 3000ms to close. condition-wait releases the mutex
;;     atomically with committing to the wait, so an insert can no longer slip
;;     between the deadline read and the wait on it.
;;   * timeout-running? used to be cleared before the idle wait, but a timer that
;;     finds the list empty waits rather than exiting — so the next insert both
;;     signalled the live thread AND forked another one, and every timer ever
;;     forked stays alive forever. 100 sequential (timeout 1) calls left 100
;;     timer threads. The flag now means "the one timer thread exists", which
;;     once true never stops being true.

;; O(k^2) to arm a burst — and the consumer only ever takes the MIN, which is
;; the heap's O(log k) case. Entries with EQUAL deadlines pop in arbitrary
;; order; they were already batched into one collect, so nothing promised an
;; order between them.
;;
;; CANCELLING IS LAZY. A wait that ends before its deadline — a timed socket read
;; that got its data, a timed deref that got its value — cancels its entry
;; (jolt-timer-cancel!), which drops the thunk on the spot: the entry's cdr
;; becomes #f, so the heap no longer keeps the waiter, or anything the thunk
;; closes over, reachable. Before this, a fiber that parked with a 5-minute
;; SO_TIMEOUT stayed pinned by the heap for 5 minutes after its read returned.
;; The dead entry itself stays in place and is dropped when it reaches the top;
;; once dead entries outnumber live ones the heap is rebuilt from the live ones,
;; so it never holds more than twice what is pending. An eager remove would need
;; every entry to carry its slot, and keeping that slot current costs every sift
;; a write — measured at 1.25x on arming, which pays for cancels that most
;; deadlines never see. This way arming is unchanged and a cancel is O(1).

;; *go-backend* is read at spawn time off a dynamic binding, so which backend ran
;; a body is a property of the caller's binding, not of the code that spawned it;
;; and within the fiber backend, whether the CPS pass could rewrite the body
;; decides between two spawn paths, which is a property of the body. A monitor
;; that reported on some of those and answered "clean" for the rest would be
;; worse than no monitor, because a caller cannot tell from the jolt side which
;; one it got. sm.ss makes the same argument for its own two spawn paths.
;;
;; Completion is published HERE, by every path that terminally closes a go
;; channel, before the close: a reader woken by the close then finds the monitor
;; already settled.
;;
;; WEAK, and keyed by the channel: a strong table would pin every go channel and
;; its outcome for the life of the process, which on a server spawning a go per
;; request is an unbounded leak. A dropped channel takes its entry with it, and
;; the only thing lost is the ability to monitor a go block nobody holds any more.
;;
;; #(done? error monitors) — allocated by the spawn, so a monitor registered on a
;; channel with no entry (a plain chan, or a go channel whose entry the collector
;; took) reads as "nothing to report" rather than raising.

;; been loaded, and the native pair was dead in every configuration that matters
;; (the loader drops clojure.core.async from loaded-ns precisely so a require
;; always pulls the overlay). One definition now, in the overlay, where the CPS
;; pass can reach &env / macroexpand / resolve.

;; the way upstream reads it: impl.protocols installs, by __set-port-reader!, a fn that
;; turns such a port into a promise-chan its take! delivers into

;; visibly exists. Reserve the two names with a stub that says what to do instead.
;; MARKED a macro, so it raises from the EXPANDER with the body still unevaluated.
;; As a plain fn the stub was reached as an ordinary call, which evaluates the body
;; as arguments first: (clojure.core.async/go (swap! a conj :x)) ran the swap! and
;; then reported that nothing had, and a body that parks —
;; (clojure.core.async/go (clojure.core.async/<! ch)) on an empty channel — blocked
;; forever instead of reporting anything at all, which is worse than the "No such
;; var" this exists to improve on. natives-reader.ss reserves `letfn` with an
;; unmarked fn, but that stub is unreachable (the analyzer lowers every letfn form
;; before any macro runs) and this one is not. The overlay's defmacro replaces both
;; roots and re-marks them.
;;
;; The message names a BARE require, not a :refer. Requiring the namespace at all
;; is what loads the overlay, and whoever reads this wrote the qualified call, so
;; telling them to refer the name asks them to rewrite a call site that is already
;; right. (require 'clojure.core.async) makes the very form that raised work.
