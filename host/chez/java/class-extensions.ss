;; class-extensions.ss — the library seam for extending a class jolt already
;; part-shims (jolt#575).
;;
;; jolt models the java.* surface with hand-written shims (io.ss, process.ss,
;; inst-time.ss, host-static-classes.ss, …) and each one covers the methods
;; jolt's own code and the ported libraries have needed so far. A library that
;; needs a method a shim does not have had exactly one way out before this:
;; __register-class-ctor! its OWN replacement for the whole class, which every
;; other namespace in the process then silently inherits — the failure mode
;; register-class-ctor-user! warns about, where swapping in a ByteArrayInputStream
;; shim makes (.readAllBytes body) unresolvable for code that never asked for it.
;; This file is the additive alternative: a library registers just the members it
;; needs against the class, and jolt's own shim keeps answering everything else.
;;
;; Two tiers, because "the shim is missing a method" and "the shim's method is
;; wrong for me" are different asks with different blast radius:
;;
;;   extend (the default)  consulted at the END of the dispatch chain, where the
;;                         call would otherwise raise "No matching method"
;;                         (dispatch-miss, records-dispatch.ss). It cannot change
;;                         the behaviour of anything jolt already answers, so two
;;                         libraries extending the same class only collide if
;;                         they claim the same missing method.
;;   override              consulted BEFORE every built-in arm
;;                         (arm-priority-user-override). It replaces jolt's
;;                         method for every caller in the process, so it is
;;                         spelled out at the call site and reported under
;;                         JOLT_DEBUG.
;;
;; Both are keyed by CLASS NAME and resolved through the modeled class graph
;; (jch-tags, class-hierarchy.ss), so a registration on java.io.Reader answers
;; for a StringReader receiver, and either spelling — java.io.File or File —
;; matches. The class name of a receiver comes from jolt-class-name, the one
;; place a value's class is decided, so this seam sees exactly the classes
;; (class x) and instance? report — which is also how a library's OWN value type
;; becomes extensible: teach (class x) about it with clojure.core/__register-class!
;; and it is addressable here by that name like any modeled class.
;;
;; Loaded LAST (after bigdec.ss): it only registers into existing registries, and
;; loading last means every class-arm that decides a value's class name is in
;; place before the first lookup can run.

;; ---- registries -------------------------------------------------------------

;; per-member flag, because the two tiers are consulted from different places in
;; the chain and a lookup must never consider the other tier's members.

;; the same reason register-tagged-methods! does: two namespaces loading in
