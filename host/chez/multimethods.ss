;;
;; defmulti/defmethod are macros that expand to ctx-capturing setup CALLS
;; (defmulti-setup / defmethod-setup, + the table ops get-method/methods/
;; remove-method/prefer-method/prefers), implemented here against
;; the runtime's ns/var machinery.
;;
;; A multimethod VALUE is a jolt-multifn record carrying its dispatch fn and a
;; mutable method table (dispatch-val -> method fn, keyed with jolt= so keyword/
;; vector/number dispatch values match by value). jolt-invoke dispatches it:
;; an exact method, else an isa?/hierarchy match (resolved through prefer-method
;; and the overlay's isa?/derive/hierarchy), else the :default method.
;;
;; NS resolution: defmulti expands to (defmulti-setup (quote name) ...) with a
;; BARE symbol — the Chez RT has no compile-time current ns at the call site, so a
;; runtime `chez-current-ns` box names where to def-var! the multifn. It defaults
;; to "user" (matching the analyzer's ns for -e user code); the assembled prelude
;; sets it to "clojure.core" around its own load (program-with-prelude), so the
;; print-method/print-dup defmultis land in clojure.core. defmethod-setup and the
;; symbol-taking table ops resolve the multifn via (var-deref (chez-current-ns) …),
;; so they agree with defmulti. Loaded from rt.ss after seq.ss (jolt-invoke),
;; collections.ss (jolt=/key-hash/jolt-hash-map) and the var-cell machinery.

;; THREAD-LOCAL: a Chez thread-parameter, so each OS thread (an nREPL
;; session worker / future) has its own current ns — vars stay global, only the
;; "current ns" pointer is per-thread, matching Clojure's thread-local *ns*. A new
;; thread inherits the forking thread's value. `star-ns-cell` (the *ns* var cell,
;; captured by dyn-binding.ss once *ns* exists) lets chez-current-ns DERIVE from a
;; thread-local (binding [*ns* ..]) so a bound *ns* drives load-string/analyzer
;; resolution; bootstrap-safe (it's #f until then, so we just read the parameter).

;; The WRITE half of the same seam, and it has to target whatever the read half
;; would consult or the two disagree: chez-current-ns prefers a live (binding
;; [*ns* ..]) over the parameter, so writing only the parameter under such a
;; binding is a write that no read can see. JVM parity too — (set! *ns* ..) is
;; Var.set, which writes the innermost thread binding and leaves the root alone,
;; so the binding frame popping still restores the ns that was current before it.
;;
;; What the asymmetry cost: ldr-load-body saves the current ns and restores it on
;; the way out so a loaded file's ns form cannot leak past its own load. Under a
;; *ns* binding that restore silently did nothing, so a nested require left *ns*
;; pointing at the LAST file it finished — every def after the require in the
;; requiring file interned into the wrong namespace.
;;
;; Bootstrap-safe by the same star-ns-cell test chez-current-ns uses: it is #f
;; until dyn-binding.ss captures the cell, and the boot writes just set the
;; parameter.
;;
;; And it keeps Var.set's owner rule, as jolt-set-var! does: a frame conveyed to
;; another fiber (a go block, a future) is shared with the one that bound it, so a
