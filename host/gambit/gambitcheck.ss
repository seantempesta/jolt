;; gambitcheck.ss — the G1 gate for the Gambit adapter (jolt-mj95.2).
;;
;; Run via `make gambitcheck` (detection-gated: skips when gambit-scheme is
;; absent, and always uses $(brew --prefix gambit-scheme)/bin/gsi — NEVER bare
;; gsc/gsi, which is Ghostscript on this machine). Run from the repo root.
;;
;; Loads the three gambit target files (prelude-shims, scheme-adapter-runtime,
;; hasheq), then:
;;   (a) asserts every host/scheme-adapter/CONTRACT.txt name is bound
;;       (or shimmed — variables via eval, syntax shims via the explicit list,
;;       each ALSO verified behaviorally by the unit tests below),
;;   (b) unit-tests every shim group: record round-trip incl. the parent
;;       clause family, hashtable CRUD + entries + weak-eq, fx + bitwise
;;       aliases, condition accessors on a caught error, condvar wait/signal,
;;       parameter fork-inheritance, with-mutex, hasheq known-answer rows
;;       (captured from the Chez build via bin/jolt), and the sa-* raise
;;       surface (message-carrying conditions).
;;
;; The hasheq known-answer rows pin VALUE PARITY with the Chez build: each row
;; is a pure hasheq function whose output was captured from `bin/jolt` on the
;; Chez runtime (the jolt-level (hash ...) routes through exactly these
;; functions). Rows for the vector/map shapes compute the hash-ordered /
;; hash-unordered combinator math directly — the cseq/pmap iteration over them
;; is G2 scope (the full runtime), the murmur3 + combinator math is G1.
;;
;; NO import here: the prelude's (import (except (gambit) define-record-type))
;; is the single import point for the whole boot path. A file-level import in
;; THIS file would create a module boundary and the loaded shim macros
;; (define-record-type, fx aliases, with-mutex, the sa-foreign-* syntaxes)
;; would not resolve here — the (gambit) names come from the prelude's import,
;; which loads into the same top level.

;; ---- splice the three target files ------------------------------------------
;;
;; ##include (NOT load): each loaded file is a SEPARATE compilation unit, and a
;; define-syntax inside a loaded file registers only in its own unit's macro
;; environment — the loading file's LATER forms never see it (defines leak at
;; runtime into the shared global, macros don't). The prelude's record/fx/
;; with-mutex shims are macros, so gambitcheck must expand in the SAME unit as
;; the prelude: ##include textually splices the three files here, exactly the
;; "compile the boot files together" flow the G2 build uses.

;; hasheq's seq/symbol arms test jolt-nil? — a values.ss kernel name that only
;; boots in G2. A sentinel stub stands in for this gate; the known-answer rows
;; below never construct jolt-nil, so the stub is only ever asked "is this
;; ordinary value nil" (answer: no). G2's boot manifest loads the real one.
