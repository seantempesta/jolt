;; s without the members keep? rejects, dropped by disj-ing each one out of s
;; itself (the reference's idiom: it keeps s's type, comparator and meta, and
;; costs only the drops). disj answers by value, so a member not equal to
;; itself (##NaN, or a collection holding one) can't be found that way -- the
;; JVM's disj gets it by reference identity. A disj that misses answers the set
;; itself, and the first such miss rebuilds from (empty s) instead, which keeps
;; the same type, comparator and meta.
