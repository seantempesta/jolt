# Build and check jolt on bionic (Android), inside termux/termux-docker (#943).
# Run by .github/workflows/release.yml and tests.yml on an arm64 runner as:
#
#   docker run -v <workspace>:/src <termux-image> \
#     env JOLT_VERSION=<v> sh /src/ci/termux-build.sh [GATES...]
#
# (env inside the command: the image's entrypoint drops to its user with env -i,
# so a `docker run -e` variable never arrives.)
#
# The workspace is copied into $HOME first: Termux runs as an unprivileged user
# that cannot write the host mount, and its filesystem refuses hard links. The
# Makefile's bionic path provisions the pinned Chez itself
# (host/chez/bionic-provision-chez.sh), so nothing Chez-shaped is installed here.
# Results (the binary, the report) are copied back to /src/target/release.
#
# GATES are extra make targets to run after the build (tests.yml passes one
# shard of the CI gate, `ci-shard SHARD-SET=ci SHARD=i SHARDS=n`; the release
# passes none). Every check here runs in the container,
# since the host cannot execute a bionic binary.
set -eu

# The Termux app starts every shell with termux-exec preloaded, which is what
# makes a `#!/bin/sh` script run on a system with no /bin (Chez's configure is
# one). termux-docker's entrypoint does not, so do what the app does.
