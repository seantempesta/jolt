;; build-scaling-test.ss — what keeps `jolt build` from scaling badly with the
;; size of the app (jolt-lang/jolt#1059).
;;
;; Profiling a test-heavy app of 233 namespaces put 70% of a 120s build in Chez's
;; back end: compile-file over the app half (44s, 62% of it collecting) and the
;; vfasl conversion (40s, superlinear in the image). This gate pins the build-side
;; shapes those costs depend on:
;;
;;   a. the app's init bodies are split into SMALL procedures. Chez's passes over
;;      one lambda body grow faster than the body; 100 forms per procedure
;;      compiled the 28MB app half in 49.6s, 10 per procedure in 31.2s
;;   b. the back-end steps run under a larger collect trip, and restore it after
;;   c. a vfasl conversion that fails outright says so — the in-process path used
;;      to keep the plain boot silently, after spending the time
;;   d. the vfasl image is converted in pieces: the runtime prefix once (cached),
;;      the app per unit. The whole-boot conversion re-imaged ~40MB that never
;;      changes, and is superlinear in the image (40s for a 28MB app half)
;;   e. the app half is one compile unit per namespace, cached on its text; a
;;      miss compiles in a worker (in parallel, in a real build)
;;   f. the require scan parses each file once, and the ns prelude stops at the
;;      ns form
