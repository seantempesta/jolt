# System/in, System/out, System/err — the process's own streams.
#
# System.in is an InputStream the JVM hands every program; jolt had System/out
# and System/err but no System/in at all, so any ported code that read stdin
# through it ("No matching field or method: System/in") failed to load. The
# streams also have to report the classes the JVM's do — System.out is a
# PrintStream, not the PrintWriter *out* is — because libraries branch on that.
#
# The stacking matters as much as the classes. The JVM builds *in* as a Reader
# over System.in and *out* as a PrintWriter over System.out, so a program that
# uses both sees one stream; jolt read standard input through a second port of
# its own, and the two buffered independently (jolt-6wad).
